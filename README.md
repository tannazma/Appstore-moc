TODO:
- [x] Currently on hover, we can see the Discover header. We don't want that. We want it only on scroll.
- [x] The app list (those 9 apps) mix into each other when screen is small
- [x] In the left sidebar/menu, the texts are not aligned center with the icons
- [x] Implement those 3 small icons in the top left of the sidebar
- [ ] Add search icon to the search input
- [ ] Pixel-Perfect the featured section
- [ ] Give a little space to the top of the content (just like how App Store does)
- [ ] Put 4 apps in the featured section (and enable scrolling)
